## Overview

A comprehensive comparative study analyzing curriculum similarities across **24 engineering disciplines** from over **100 universities worldwide** using advanced AI research methodologies. This interactive research website presents findings from dual AI analysis systems to understand the interconnections between various engineering fields.

## Research Scope

### ðŸ”¬ **Study Objective**
Create a quantitative 24Ã—24 similarity matrix that reveals relationships between major engineering disciplines, with similarity scores ranging from 1-100.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Hypothesis**
*"All engineering disciplines derive from four main engineering branches: Mechanical, Electrical, Civil, and Chemical."*

### ðŸ“Š **Research Scale**
- **24** Engineering Disciplines Analyzed
- **100+** Universities Worldwide  
- **50+** Countries Covered
- **576** Similarity Comparisons
- **Dual AI** Analysis Systems (Google Gemini + Manus AI)

## Engineering Disciplines Studied

The study covers major engineering fields including:
- Software, Mechanical, Civil, Electrical Engineering
- Computer, Chemical, Industrial, Aerospace Engineering  
- Biomedical, Environmental, Petroleum, Materials Engineering
- Nuclear, Marine, Geotechnical, Robotics Engineering
- And 8 additional specialized engineering disciplines

## Methodology

1. **Curriculum Research**: Analysis of core courses, prerequisites, and specializations from top global universities
2. **Institution Coverage**: Including prestigious institutions like MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Caltech, Oxford, Cambridge, ETH Zurich
3. **Global Perspective**: Universities from USA, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, UK, Japan, China, UAE, and 40+ more countries
4. **AI Analysis**: Dual-system approach using Google Gemini and Manus AI for comprehensive validation
5. **Comparative Framework**: Mathematical foundations, practical applications, and curriculum structure analysis
